# MarketingGame
Project for the Data Bases II exam. 
The project consists in a simple website to ask customers questions about a product they are displayed. 
The product is supposed to change every day. 

The aim was to test the competence with Java Persistence API/JEE and Java Beans so the UX is rather poor.
The application is structured in three layers: the website, the application layer and the MySQL data server.
It can be deployed using Tomcat and MySQL.
